#Chris Fenton Week 3 IS607 Assignment

First, I'll format the github url using the RCurl package, and use it to
download into a DF object.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(RCurl)

ds_url <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/
                    daily-show-guests/daily_show_guests.csv")
daily_show <- read.csv(text=ds_url)
```

Here I'm just going to pare down to the bare minimum, although the .csv was
already pretty light.

```{r eval=FALSE}
daily_show_guests <- daily_show[,c(1, 4)]
```

Perhaps I want to compare 2001 to 2002, with the intent of seeing if
the Daily Show became more political focused in the wake of 9/11.

```{r eval=FALSE}
daily_show_guests_2001 <- daily_show[daily_show$YEAR == 2001,c(1, 4:5)]
daily_show_guests_2002 <- daily_show[daily_show$YEAR == 2002,c(1, 4:5)]
```

Now I have two objects, and I am ready to do some comparisons.
